#Fulcrum Wiki

##Getting Access

You should receive two emails:

- Github invite “...added you to the Hack Reactor team fulcrum-students”
- Slack invite “...has invited you to join Hack Reactor Fulcrum on Slack”
Github

You’ll need to accept the github invitation linked in the email. If you don’t see the email, visit <https://github.com/hackreactor> then click View Invitation on the top right corner. Accept.

You can now access the curriculum at <http://fulcrum.hackreactor.com/>

###Slack*

Follow the instructions in the email. Our Slack channel is <https://hrf1.slack.com>

*Currently we have to add you manually to Slack so it may take up to a day for your invitation to be sent.


##Student Dashboard
Another critical piece of Fulcrum is the [Student Dashboard](https://fulcrumdashboard.herokuapp.com/). The Dashboard will allow you to:

- update your personal information
- track your progress
- request technical mentor check-ins and interviews
- apply for coding schools
- create help requests (coming soon)

Fulcrum staff will be using this data to prioritize check-ins and interviews. It is in your best interest to keep it up to date!



##Timelines

While Fulcrum is a self-paced curriculum, we highly recommend setting a goal for completing the curriculum and doing your best to track to that Timeline. Please see our recommended [Timelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HYdyvLejbMlAibkjvmotT7n2GhbFeRTg55YfOok0mpk/edit?usp=sharing).



##Mentor Check-ins

We will provide two 1-on-1 mentor check-ins to assess your understanding of the material. They are to be scheduled after you have finished the Underbar 2 sprint and the Twittler sprints.

We will be releasing a progress tracking app very soon that will assist in scheduling these check-ins.

##Mentor Sessions

We're exploring different ways to provide additional support to our students. Currently we host multiple mentor sessions per week. Stay tuned to your emails for more information.
